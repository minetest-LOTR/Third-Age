## Lord of the Test: Third Age - A minetest subgame
### Version: Alpha

This is a game for Minetest that adds [Lord of the Rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings) elements into the game.  
Lord of the Test: Third Age is a complete rewrite of Lord of the Test.  
It seeks to explore many new principles and gameplay elements, for a new, optimized and a fun Lord of the Test.  
For more information, see the [README.md](https://github.com/minetest-LOTR/Lord-of-the-Test/blob/master/README.md) of the old Lord of the Test.

**WARNING: THIS IS A TOTAL REWRITE OF LOTT. Things will be *very* broken, and DO NOT use it with older maps, as they will break completely...**
